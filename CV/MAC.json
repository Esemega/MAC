      "description": "I have never worked in tech. Last year I finished a master's degree in industrial automation and robotics, since then I have been looking for a job, but it seems that I haven't the profile searched by companies. I thought it is because I haven’t a background in electricity neither in programming. Therefore I decided to learn how to code. Since I wanted to learn programming as well as find a job, I thought that the better path was to become a web developer, because it seems that it is an in-demand job, but the learning curve is acceptable if you want to change your career path in 1 - 2 years. I’m doing a javascript course right now. Further info, I studied chemical engineering more than 8 years ago and since then I’m working in a company that manufactures toys, taking care of the safety of them. I’m used to reading and writing in English but I need to improve my communication skill."
